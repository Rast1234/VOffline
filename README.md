Evacuate from VK! ðŸšš

### This tool can save almost everything from public VK content (wall, posts, comments, photos, polls, **audio**).


It works fine but needs some polishing and documentation is not yet done.
To start, look at `appsettings.json`, it is pretty self explanatory. For now you will need Visual Studio to buld and run the thing.
